__LSTM, RNN, GRU - 2018__

This program is a simple comparasion of recurrent neural networks (RNN, GRU, LSTM) 
implemented in TensorFlow framework. They base on on  Baby Names from Social Security 
Card Applications - Data by State and District of Columbia

This in only one Jupyter notebook, because code was executed in Google Collab 
 
 `src.py` - main noteboor which train, test and visualise neural network
 
 `namebystate` -  folder with dataset
